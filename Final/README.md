I designed the layout for four of pages of this site and used bootstrap html and css to make this design. I used minmal Javascript and only used it to implement core functionalities. We plan on rewriting the site using php and to dynamically create pages. For the most part this project seems to be going
well and we will start to work perodically on the site as we rushed the end. Overall I think this project will be successful and perform its intented function.
