I designed the layout for four of pages of this site and used bootstrap html and css to make this design. I used minmal Javascript and only used it to implement core functionalities. We plan on rewriting the site using php and to dynamically create pages. For the most part this project seems to be going
well and we will start to work perodically on the site as we rushed the end. Overall I think this project will be successful and perform its intented function. I added Create Read and Delete functionality to the website with PHP. I created an API (IDK if it would actually be considered one) that returns subcategories based on categories and subcategories based on other subcategories. I created the relations in the database. I implemented a post get redirect pattern on forms although I did not use headers and instead echoed a script with a location.href. I adjusted design accordingly with the content that is dynamically loaded on to the page. I used PDO prepare and htmlspecialchars trim to help prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. This was a super swag money baller project not gonna lie.

I helped design layout for a couple of the pages and also works with Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML in order to help finish the project, and me and Cian discussed design ideas throughout. I created the sign-up form and used Bootstrap elements to make it as aesthetically pleasing as possible. I also fixed the directories of all our files, as they were all mostly stored in the root, and made an organized resources folder for everything that we used in its own subfolder. I also fixed all the validation errors that we had on each page and our CSS file. I definitely am excited to start working on the backend of the site, as I love working with that aspect of website design. I also worked with Sam on designing our slides presentation, focusing on the readability for an audience and how it looks.
