        <p class="body-text"> Our Terms of Service were last updated on 12/5/2022 </p>
        <p class="body-text"> Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using
            our
            website (the "Service") operated by The Rensselear List Team ("us",
            "we", or "our"). </p>
        <h2 class="sec-head-2">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="body-text">Welcome to our online marketplace! By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be
            bound by
            these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our
            platform.</p>
        <h2 class="sec-head-2">Transactions and Meetups</h2>
        <p class="body-text">Our platform is designed and intended to ONLY connect buyers and sellers. It is not the
            responsibility of us to process payments or mediate pickups. The marketplace, including all services and
            content
            provided through the marketplace, is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any warranties
            of
            any kind, either express or implied. The marketplace, its owners, and its affiliates are not liable for any
            damages, losses, or expenses arising from the use or inability to use the marketplace, or from any content
            or
            services obtained through the marketplace, including any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
            punitive damages, even if the marketplace has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This
            limitation
            of liability applies to all claims of any kind, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, or
            otherwise.
            In no event shall the total liability of the marketplace, its owners, and its affiliates to any user for any
            and
            all damages, losses, and causes of action exceed the amount paid by the user to the marketplace in the
            previous
            12 months, if any.</p>
        <h2 class="sec-head-2">Buyer to Seller Communication</h2>
        <p class="body-text">It is strongly recommended for the safety of both buyers and sellers that the RPI mailing
            system is exclusively used to communicate. Communication on the marketplace is limited to Rensselaer
            Polytechnic
            Institute email addresses provided to sellers. Any communication received from a non-Rensselaer Polytechnic
            Institute email address will not be considered valid. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your
            account
            if we determine that you are using a non-Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute email address for communication
            after
            the confirmation of purchase. </p>
