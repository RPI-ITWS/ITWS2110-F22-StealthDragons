        All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of
        the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of
        Representatives.
      </p>
      <h3 class="CD-head">Section 2</h3>
      <p class="CD-body">
        The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every
        second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in
        each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the
        most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. No Person shall be a
        Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five
        Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who
        shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he
        shall be chosen. Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned
        among the several States which may be included within this Union,
        according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by
        adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to
        Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three
        fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within
        three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United
        States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as
        they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed
        one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one
        Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of
        New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight,
        Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York
        six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six,
        Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia
        three. When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the
        Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such
        Vacancies. The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and
        other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

        The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from
        each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each
        Senator shall have one Vote. Immediately after they shall be assembled
        in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally
        as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first
        Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the
        second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third
        Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be
        chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or
        otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the
        Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting
        of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies. No Person
        shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty
        Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall
        not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be
        chosen. The Vice President of the United States shall be President of
        the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided. The
        Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro
        tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise
        the Office of President of the United States. The Senate shall have the
        sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they
        shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States
        is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be
        convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
        Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to
        removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office
        of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party
        convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial,
        Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.

        Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. The Congress
        shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on
        the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a
        different Day.

        constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn
        from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of
        absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House
        may provide. Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,
        punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence
        of two thirds, expel a Member. Each House shall keep a Journal of its
        Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such
        Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of
        the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one
        fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. Neither House, during
        the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other,
        adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in
        which the two Houses shall be sitting.

        Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the
        United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and
        Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance
        at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning
        from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall
        not be questioned in any other Place. No Senator or Representative
        shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any
        civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have
        been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during
        such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States,
        shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.

        All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of
        Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as
        on other Bills. Every Bill which shall have passed the House of
        Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be
        presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall
        sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that
        House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections
        at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such
        Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill,
        it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by
        which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds
        of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of
        both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the
        Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal
        of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the
        President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been
        presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had
        signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return,
        in which Case it shall not be a Law. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to
        which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be
        necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to
        the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take
        Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be
        repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives,

        The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States
        of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and,
        together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected,
        as follows Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature
        thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
        Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the
        Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office
        of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an
        Elector. The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by
        Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant
        of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the
        Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they
        shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the
        Government of the United States, directed to the President of the
        Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate
        and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes
        shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes
        shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number
        of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such
        Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of
        Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for
        President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest
        on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But
        in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the
        Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this
        Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the
        States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice.
        In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the
        greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President.
        But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate
        shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President. The Congress may
        determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they
        shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the
        United States. No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of
        the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution,
        shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person
        be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of
        thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United

        Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of
        the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the
        Congress may by law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation
        or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what
        Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act
        accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be
        elected. The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services,
        a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during
        the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not
        receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States,
        or any of them. Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall
        take the following Oath or Affirmation:– I do solemnly swear (or affirm)
        that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
        States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend

                It also protects against double-jeopardy, where you can be

                This amendment basically opens up the pathway for "inferred"
                rights, saying that the rights not specifically outlined in the
                Constituiton are not to be solely distributed by the Government.
                Rather, the people own them until stated otherwise. This is very
                important, as otherwise, the Government could have control over
                anything not stated in writing - like banning your right to eat
                cereal in the morning!

                This amendment is also used to protect the writes of those not
                explicitly given. It states that powers not explicitly given
                belong to either the people or the states. It goes hand-in-hand
                with the ninth amendment, extending powers to the states.
