Aaryaman:

I helped work on some design elements, such as the accordion, where I helped decide on the widths and
placement. Through this, I also gained a better understanding of how bootstrap classes and elements work. I
also gained more conceptual knowledge about bootstrap css variables, and how they work on underlying HTML
infrastructure. I also wrote the descriptions and analyses for all the amendments, and with the original way
we had the accordions set up, it looked very small, bare, and odd. Therefore, I changed some aspects of the
accordion, making them smaller in width and better looking on the screen. It was also cool seeing the
implementation of the sticky header bar and menu. This was a cool lab to work on.
