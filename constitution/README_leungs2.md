Sam:

I worked on the basic HTML formatting for all the Articles with Cian. We decided on creating an accordian for
the summaries and use bootstrap for the containers. I worked with him to copy and format all of the Constitution
into the website. Then we decided on how we wanted the navbar to work. After Cian and Aaryaman touched up the 
website, I finished the basic summaries for articles I and II.
