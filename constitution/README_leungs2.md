Sam:

I worked on the basic HTML formatting for all the Articles with Cian. We decided on creating an accordian for
the summaries and use bootstrap for the containers. We wanted to create 2 accordions, one with the summaries 
that included links to a second accordion for the actual articles and sections. However, it was too hard to link
them so we decided on just one accordion and links in the Navbar to each article. I worked with him to copy and 
format all of the Constitution into the website. Then we decided on how we wanted the navbar to work. After Cian 
and Aaryaman touched up the website, I finished the basic summaries for articles I and II.
