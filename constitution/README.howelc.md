Lab 02:

The lab was fun. Designed it to be kind of a late 2000s themed kids website. The entire website was put into bootstrap(bs)
containers to make it work on mobile The website header was created by making background gradients and clipping them 
to the text. The first two words were put in a span with a radial gradient to make the "stars"pattern for the flag. 
The stripes were made with a 180 degree gradient and alternating colors. The nav bar is a bs toggle nav bar and at 992 pixels
becomes a toggler. The nav bar includes a drop down for the amendments. The rest of the site is set up identically in sections
containing a title, accordian explanation, and the content of the article/amendment. Overall it was pretty cool to make this site.
