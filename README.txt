Lab 01: 

Cian:

I started this lab extremely early, as I knew I had obligations in the days leading up to the due date. Over the summer I did a lot of front-end development, so much of 
this lab was automatic to me and took me very little time to complete. I intially wanted to make the site fully dynamic, as I used bootstrap and helped many people who 
did not know how to code use webflow, to make dynamic sites. This became far too time consuming for my time frame. The website works on mobile but is not formatted optimally. 
I used grid and flex quite a bit, although I am not as skilled at it anymore from lack of use and the bootstrap crutch. I would like to throughout the semester improve my skill with grid, 
as it is extremely useful for development across screen sizes. I spent many hours over the summer creating and refining general root elements and media queries to help with 
screen size compatibility and site-wide editing, these can be seen on this website and will likely be on many websites I make. I went through this CSS with the group and 
showed them how everything works, how to utilize, and how change it. I did not know how to create the collapsable nav bar without JS. To create this I watch a video on how to use a checkbox
input. Overall, this lab was cool because I got to refresh myself with vanilla front-end and I was able to see my improvement from last year's resume.


Sam:

I created my resume site and css styling mostly based off of what I learned from Intro to IT and my personal site from last year. While I realized there was a lot
of css formatting and html stuff that my groupmates knew, I decided not to use what I learned from them because the Professor mentioned in class that he wanted to 
gauge our individual abilities. After asking Cian how he styled his webpage, I learned a lot about what he did with his webpage, but I do not believe that I understood the code enough to warrant usage of it in my own personal page. Instead, I stuck to the simpler html that I knew, which were just lists and line breaks to separate the sections. I attempted to position the picture, but I believe I used HTML 1.0 strict last year which allowed an align= inside the image bracket but I could not get it to validate in the new HTML format. In addition, I also could not get a <header></header> to validate when I tried adding a header picture on the top of my website. After about 2 hours of playing around with that, I just decided to submit what I could validate on the website, and then try to help and understand what my groupmates had done on the index.html. I learned that I have a lot to catch up on regarding html and css, because I have no real world experience unlike my groupmates. I will need to watch some videos on it and catch up to their skill level.
