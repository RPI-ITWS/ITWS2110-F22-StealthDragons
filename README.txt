Lab 01: 

Cian:

I started this lab extremely early, as I knew I had obligations in the days leading up to the due date. Over the summer I did a lot of front-end development, so much of 
this lab was automatic to me and took me very little time to complete. I intially wanted to make the site fully dynamic, as I used bootstrap and helped many people who 
did not know how to code use webflow, to make dynamic sites. This became far too time consuming for my time frame. The website works on mobile but is not formatted optimally. 
I used grid and flex quite a bit, although I am not as skilled at it anymore from lack of use and the bootstrap crutch. I would like to throughout the semester improve my skill with grid, 
as it is extremely useful for development across screen sizes. I spent many hours over the summer creating and refining general root elements and media queries to help with 
screen size compatibility and site-wide editing, these can be seen on this website and will likely be on many websites I make. I went through this CSS with the group and 
showed them how everything works, how to utilize, and how change it. I did not know how to create the collapsable nav bar without JS. To create this I watch a video on how to use a checkbox
input. Overall, this lab was cool because I got to refresh myself with vanilla front-end and I was able to see my improvement from last year's resume.
